# Grapher
I love Desmos and use it all the time, but I was disappointed when I found out they didn't support slope and vector fields. So I decided to take on the challenge and code my own graphing calc with the desired functionality. After a few days of hard work, I'm proud to present the result, Grapher!

## Features
* Graph functions, slope fields, vector fields, polar, and parametric
* Zoom in and out (with animations ðŸ¥³)
* Beautiful rendering on Javascript canvas
* Powerful and intuitive syntax
* Set custom domain for polar and parametric graphs

## Guide + Demos
**Functions:** Enter a function f(x) by writing any expression with the x variable. Separate multiple graphs with semicolons. 

```
x^2; sin(x - 2); -3(x + 4); 1/x
```

**Slope Fields:** Use the prefix `s:` and enter an expression in terms of x and y.

```
s: cos(x); sin(x); sin(x) + 2; sin(x) - 2;
```

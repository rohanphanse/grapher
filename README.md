# Grapher
I love [Desmos](https://www.desmos.com/calculator) and use it all the time, but I was disappointed when I found out they didn't support slope and vector fields. So I decided to take on the challenge and code my own graphing calc with the desired functionality. After a lot of hard work and some intense mathematics ðŸ™‚, I'm proud to present the result, Grapher!

## Features
* Graph functions, slope fields, vector fields, polar, and parametric
* Zoom in and out (with animations ðŸ¥³)
* Beautiful rendering on Javascript canvas
* Powerful and intuitive syntax
* Set custom domain for polar and parametric graphs

## Guide + Demos
**Functions:** Enter a function f(x) by writing any expression with the `x` variable. Separate multiple graphs with semicolons. 

For this demo, I've graphed the parabola `x^2`, the sine curve `sin(x) - 2`, the line `-3(x + 4)`, and the function `1/x`.

I'm using the wonderful [math.js](https://mathjs.org/docs/reference/functions.html) library for evaluating math expressions. Here are a few useful functions and constants you can use in Grapher.

* Trig functions: `sin(x)`, `cos(x)`, `tan(x)`, `sec(x)`, `asin(x)` (inverse sine), ...
* Square root: `sqrt(x)`
* Natural logarithm (base e): `log(x)`
* Constants: `pi`, `e`


**Slope Fields:** Start off with the prefix `s:` and enter an expression in terms of `x` and `y`.

For this demo, I'm graphing the family of sine curves `sin(x) + C` and the slope field of `cos(x)`. I've also included a hyperbola `x^2 - y^2 = 1` and the slope field `x/y`.

**Vector Fields:** Use the prefix `v:` and enter an expression in the form of `v: (f(x, y), g(x, y))`. The 2 functions of `x` and `y` inside the paranetheses are the x- and y-components of the vector.

For this demo, I've graphed a dipole vector field, which represents the electric field lines between a positive and negative charge in physics.

**Polar:** Use the prefix `r = ` and enter an expression in the form of `r = f(t)`.

For this demo, I've graphed 4 polar curves:
1. Rose curve: `r = sin(4t)` (8 petals)
2. Archimedes spiral: `r = t [0, 16pi]` (setting custom t-domain, default is `[0, 2pi]`)
3. LimaÃ§ons: `r = 1 + sin(t)` (cardioid), `r = 1 + 2sin(t)` (inner loop), and `r = 3 + 2sin(t)` (dimpled)
4. Circles: `r = 0; r = -5sin(t); r = 4cos(t); r = -3cos(t)` (using r = 0 as dummy graph to get nice colors ðŸ˜Ž)

**Parametric:** Use prefix `p:` and enter in form of `p: x = f(t), y = g(t)`. 

For this demo, I've graphed the beautiful [butterfly curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_curve_(transcendental)). Because this curve is so intricate, I upped the numbers of intervals from 1,000 (default) to 10,000.

Bonus: [Gamma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_function) function, the continuation of the factorial function to decimal and complex numbers.

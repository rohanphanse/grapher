# Grapher
I love Desmos and use it all the time, but I was disappointed when I found out they didn't support slope and vector fields. So I decided to take on the challenge and code my own graphing calc with the desired functionality. After a few days of hard work, I'm proud to present to you the result, Grapher!

## Features
* Graph functions, slope fields, vector fields, polar, and parametric
* Zoom in and out (with animations ðŸ¥³)
* Beautiful rendering with Javascript canvas
* Powerful and intuitive syntax
* Set range of parameter variable for polar and parametric

## Guide + Demos
**Functions:** Enter a function f(x) by writing any expression with the x variable. Separate multiple graphs with semicolons.

I'm using the wonderful math.js library to evaluate the math expressions.

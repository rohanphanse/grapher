# Grapher
I love Desmos and use it all the time, but I was disappointed when I found out they didn't support slope and vector fields. So I decided to take on the challenge and code my own graphing calc with the desired functionality. After a lot of hard work and some intense mathematics ðŸ™‚, I'm proud to present the result, Grapher!

## Features
* Graph functions, slope fields, vector fields, polar, and parametric
* Zoom in and out (with animations ðŸ¥³)
* Beautiful rendering on Javascript canvas
* Powerful and intuitive syntax
* Set custom domain for polar and parametric graphs

## Guide + Demos
**Functions:** Enter a function f(x) by writing any expression with the x variable. Separate multiple graphs with semicolons.

**Slope Fields:** Use the prefix `s:` and enter an expression in terms of x and y.

</p>

**Vector Fields:** Use the prefix `v:` and enter 2 expressions in terms of x and y inside parentheses separated by a comma. The 2 expressions represent the x- and y-components of the vector respectively.

**Polar:** Use the prefix `r = ` and enter an expression in terms of `t`.

Set custom domain for parameter variable t by specifying min and max inside of square brackets separated by comma. For example, `r = t [0, 16pi]` goes from t = 0 to t = 16pi. Default domain is `[0, 2pi]`.

**Parametric:** Enter parametric graphs in the form of `p: x = f(t), y = g(t)`. For this demo, I've graphed the beautiful [butterfly curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_curve_(transcendental)). Because this curve is so intricate, I upped the numbers of intervals (distinct line segments) from the default 1,000 to 10,000.
